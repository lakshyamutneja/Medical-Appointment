# Medical-Appointment
Project aims at predicting if people show up for their medical appointments or not. It is important for the understanding of patients' behaviour and their reasons for not showing up for their scheduled medical appointments.I have seen many doctors and hospital staffs suffer with the issue of rescheduling and cancelling appointments. It kills a lot of their time and energy. With this analysis, I feel it would be easy for them to schedule appointments keeping in mind the patient's behaviour and will help them to take care of it and manage more efficiently.
